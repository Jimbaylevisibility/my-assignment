    <!--This is question one which i spoke briefly about the problem encountered by university students studying foreign language -->
    <h2>La probleme que l'associe de l'apprendre une langue etrangere</h2>
    <p>La langue francaise est une belle langue, il surpose que l'etudiant va <em>ecris, ris,
        entendre et parler</em>, pour ameliorer la langue francaise ou en langue different. Mais, la bonne problem
        de l'etudiante de la langue etrangere c'est <strong>procrastination</strong>, que est le voleur du temps. Le temps en temps,
        l'etudiant a dit que la langue francaise est dificile, encore c'est difficile mais avec practique tous en temps,
        l'etudiant va <i>perfecter</i> la langue.

    <h3>Analysis of the peace treaties that concluded the WWI</h3>
    <p>According to VN Khanna in his book International Relations, The first world war which began on the 28th June 1914 
        has been regarded as one of the most devastating war that plunged the world. This war had been connoted as a war
        to end all wars but little was known that it set the stage for all other wars.
        The war was fought between two opposing camps, the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente. With Germany, Austria-Hungary
        Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire on one side(Triple Alliance) and Britain, France, USA, Japan and Italy on the other
        (Triple Entente). The War ended with the unconditional surrender of Germary on the 28th July 1918.
        The treaties which concluded the wars were: The Peace treaty of Versailles signed with Germany, The treaty of saint Germain
        was signed with Austria, the Treaty of Neuilly was signed with Bulgaria and Treaty of Trianon with Hungary and the Treaty of Sevres with Ottoman
        empire but later the treaty of Lausaine with Turkey which became the offshot of the fallen empire of Ottoman.
